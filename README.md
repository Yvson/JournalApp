# JournalApp
This app was originally created by Marco L. Napoli (@JediPixels) in his book entitled "Beginning Flutter: A Hands On Guide To App Development" and slightly modified by me.



## Basic requirements

### Create a new Firebase Project


### Replace google-services.json


### Setting build.gradle

1) Open the file `\JournalApp\android\app\build.gradle`

2) Replace the line `applicationId "com.domainname.journal"` with the Android Package Name chosen in the firebase project configuration.
